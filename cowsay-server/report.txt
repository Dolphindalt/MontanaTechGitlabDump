1. I did.

2. 
-k means keep open. The command will stay running so multiple clients (or the same over and over) 
may connect. With -k, we can continue to execute the nc command without the ncat command terminating.

3.
files=(/usr/share/cowsay/cows/*)
The files is the variable we are setting. The parentheses is a list of commands to be executed. 
Since the string in the list has regex in it that will be evaluated, we need the list to store 
all of the values we are going to obtain.

echo ${files[$RANDOM%${#files[@]}]}
echo prints the output to the terminal. The $ means to get the value of the variable we are dealing with.
The curly braces executes the contents in the current shell context. We use $ to get the value of the 
variable RANDOM which is a RANDOM number. files[@] gets all of the files in this list but # counts them and 
returns an integer. This is all executed inside the current shell context by ${}. The random number mod 
length of files is taken and then indexed to get a somewhat random file name. The file name is then 
printed out with echo.

4. 
On line 1, we change files=(/usr/share/cowsay/cows/*) to (cd /usr/share/cowsay/cows && ls).
Or on line 2, we can add the basename command echo `basename ${files[$RANDOM%${#files[@]}]}`.

5.
files=(/usr/share/cowsay/cows/*)
file=`basename ${files[$RANDOM%${#files[@]}]}`
fortune | cowsay -f $file

6.
files=(/usr/share/cowsay/cows/*)
file=`basename ${files[$RANDOM%${#files[@]}]}`
cowsay -f $file $(fortune)

7.
The syntax is strange but it seems to function as intended. The command is contained 
within a string, so the slash that looks so strange is actually escaping the $.

8.
The first half of the command (left of the &&) sets up the network communication as described prior. 
The difference is that the variable files is set in the bah script and then the random select is made 
for the cowfile along with the input of fortune being provided. Everything is scoped appropriately to 
execute before needed. For example, fortune executes before it is used in the cowsay command being 
executed in our special bash section started by the -c "cowsay ...".
